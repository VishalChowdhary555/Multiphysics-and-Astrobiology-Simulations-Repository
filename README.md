2. Habitable Zone Prediction Model

File: Habitable_Zone.m

Description

Calculates the inner and outer edges of a habitable zone based on planetary and stellar parameters. Incorporates albedo, atmospheric effects, and stellar flux.

3. Goldilocks Equation Solver

File: Goldilocks_Equation.m

Description

Models the Goldilocks Zone by solving for environmental conditions where life can exist. Includes temperature, pressure, and atmospheric gas composition.

4. Biosignatures Simulation

File: Biosignatures.m

Description

Simulates biosignature detection by modeling gas flux, chemical reactions, and spectral data from an exoplanet's atmosphere.

5. RNA Self-Replication Model

File: RNA_Self_Replication.m

Description

Simulates RNA replication kinetics, incorporating environmental conditions, enzyme catalysis, and error correction.

6. Extremophiles Adaptation Analysis

File: Extremophiles_Adaptation.m

Description

Models the survival probability of extremophiles under extreme conditions, such as high radiation, pressure, and temperature.

7. 3D Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) Solver

File: Exoplanet_RTE.m

Description

Solves the 3D Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) for an exoplanet's atmosphere, modeling radiation transport through absorption, scattering, and emission processes.


**Limitations and Future Work**

Current Limitations

Models are simplified for computational efficiency.

Assumes isotropic scattering in the RTE solver.

RNA replication assumes constant rate constants.

**Planned Improvements**
